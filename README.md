Mock incident report based on the TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Analyst Simulator. Includes phishing triage workflows and IOC analysis.

# 🧪 TryHackMe – SOC Level 1 Analyst Simulator Report

This repository contains a mock incident report created after completing the [SOC Level 1 Analyst Simulator](https://tryhackme.com/soc-sim) lab on TryHackMe. The lab simulates the day-to-day operations of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst, requiring triage and investigation of 11 suspicious email tickets.

The report reflects real-world incident response workflows, showcasing phishing detection, email header analysis, IOC extraction, and written documentation under pressure.
